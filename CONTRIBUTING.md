# Contributing

Thanks for looking. This is a small, single-maintainer project, and everything
below is meant to save you from writing something that then has to be rewritten.

## Where to say something

Open an issue: <https://github.com/smeet666/mcp-libraryofcongress/issues>

That is the right place for a bug, a question, an idea, or "this answer looks
wrong to me". There is no mailing list, no chat and no support address. The npm
page is not a channel: nothing posted there reaches me.

## Pull requests are welcome, but talk to me first

Please open an issue before you write the code, even when you are sure of the
fix. Not to gate you: to agree on what the right answer actually is. Most of the
decisions in this repository are about what a model should be told, and two
reasonable people land on different answers. A short exchange up front is
cheaper for you than a rewrite after review.

The exception is the obviously mechanical: a typo, a dead link, a wrong version
in the documentation. Send those straight as a pull request.

If you have already written the code, open the pull request anyway and say so.
Nothing is wasted; we will just discuss the shape in the pull request instead.

## What a good report contains

The tool you called, the arguments you passed, and what came back. A single
copy-paste of the result is worth several paragraphs of description.

If the answer was wrong rather than missing, say what you expected and why: a
passage attributed to an issue that never printed it is a real bug, and it is
only visible to someone who knows the subject.

If the server returned an error code, include it. `not_found`, `rate_limited`,
`parse_failure`, `invalid_input`, `timeout` and `network_error` mean quite
different things, and the first question is always which one you saw.

## What this server will and will not do

It reads the Library of Congress and returns what it reads. It does not write
anything back, it holds no account, and it needs no API key.

Three rules shape most of the code, and a change that breaks one of them will be
turned down however useful it looks:

- **A failure is never reported as an empty result.** If a request could not be
  made, the answer says so. Silence about a failure becomes "there is none" in
  the mouth of a model, which is a false statement about the world.
- **Every result carries its source.** Content that came from the Library goes
  out with a link to the page it came from, and the text block keeps that link
  even when it has to be shortened.
- **The server paces itself.** The Library publishes a ceiling, and the minimum
  interval between requests has a floor that configuration cannot go below,
  whether the setting arrives from the environment or from a configuration
  object handed to the published client.

## Running it locally

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test            # unit tests, everything upstream is a fixture
npm run build
npm run inspector   # drive the tools by hand in the MCP Inspector
```

The unit tests never touch the network. There is also a live suite,
`LOC_LIVE=1 npm run test:live`, which does: it makes one request per route
against https://www.loc.gov and checks the fields the parsers depend on. Run it
if you changed anything in the parsing layer, and expect it to be slow, since
the pacing applies there too.

`npm run format` before you commit.

## The shape of the code

The access layer under `src/loc` never imports the MCP SDK, and the MCP layer
under `src/tools` never performs HTTP. That separation is why the client is
published as its own subpath export and usable as a plain library, so please
keep it. Every host, route, parameter and response field the server reads lives
in `src/loc/paths.ts`, so an upstream rename is a one-file change.

The tools are `search_newspapers`, `search_items`, `get_item` and
`list_collections`. A new tool is a bigger conversation than a new field on an
existing one, which is another reason to open an issue first.

Every new output field needs a `.describe()` saying what it means, in the words
a caller would use rather than the words the site uses.

## Writing style in the code

Comments explain why, not what, and they read as if the code had always looked
this way. Someone reading the file for the first time should not have to know
what it replaced.

## When the Library changes

The upstream is a public site rather than a versioned API. When it changes
shape, the unit tests stay green because they run on generated fixtures, and the
nightly live canary is what catches it. If you see a `parse_failure` in normal
use, that is very likely what happened, and it is worth an issue with the
arguments that triggered it.
